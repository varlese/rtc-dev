🏘️ Tenants are struggling to keep our housing
🏗 Corporate landlords are developing us out of our communities
We are excited to launch our Right-to-Counsel campaign in Jersey City! Right-to-Counsel is about ensuring tenants receive legal representation with no barriers. People should have the right to be protected from landlord harassment, from eviction to unsafe living conditions.
Join us Sunday, July 24th at noon by City Hall for the inaugural rally.</description></item><item><title>Right to Counsel FAQs</title><link>https://varlese.github.io/rtc-dev/post/faq/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varlese.github.io/rtc-dev/post/faq/</guid><description>What is the right to counsel?
The right to counsel is a legal guarantee that a tenant will be granted representation by an attorney before they are evicted from their home.
How effective is the right to counsel at preventing evictions?
Studies of the jurisdictions that have passed right to counsel laws all reveal benefits to tenants. When represented through RTC programs, tenants are much more likely to stay in their homes — as much as 41% — because lawyers can help tenants identify available defenses and resources like rental assistance programs.</description></item><item><title>About Right to Counsel</title><link>https://varlese.github.io/rtc-dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varlese.github.io/rtc-dev/about/</guid><description>Nationwide, only 3% of tenants are represented in housing court, while for landlords that’s more like 81% on average. Housing is a human right and no one should have to fight for their homes without fair representation. It’s time to demand Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. We need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants.
A right to counsel for tenants While Americans have a right to counsel for criminal proceedings, we only have a patchwork of coverage for representation if threatened with eviction.</description></item><item><title>Take Action</title><link>https://varlese.github.io/rtc-dev/take-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varlese.github.io/rtc-dev/take-action/</guid><description>We will be organizing city-wide canvasses and phonebanks.
