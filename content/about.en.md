Nationwide, only 3% of tenants are represented in housing court, while for landlords that’s more like 81% on average. Housing is a human right and no one should have to fight for their homes without fair representation. It’s time to demand Jersey City level the playing field and reign in landlord power. **We need to guarantee the right to counsel for ALL tenants.**

## A right to counsel for tenants

While Americans have a right to counsel for criminal proceedings, we only have a patchwork of coverage for representation if threatened with eviction. Like we’re seeing with the many rollbacks of our rights right now, we can’t play the game of “justice by geography.” In 2017 before NYC was the first city to pass a right to counsel, on average, 95% of landlords were represented in court while less than 1% of tenants were. When represented, however, [tenants overwhelmingly end up staying in their homes](http://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/275/NCCRC_2021_eviction_RTC_talking_points.pdf), get more time and money to move, and even avoid getting an eviction on their record. Now [3 states and 15 cities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bqYFObTyKTImXtgNwz7xdq3qeUIXkyyN/view) (NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Cleveland and Newark to name a few) have a right to counsel for evictions. Unlike Newark’s ‘right’ to counsel that only covers single person households making under $27,000, we believe a “right” means no means-testing. No evictions without representation. The right should also be a right to affirm tenants rights like hospitality, counterclaims and appeals. 

## Justice for all

The housing crisis is a racial justice crisis. The neighborhoods targeted by developers see the highest rate of evictions, and to no surprise they are usually Black, Hispanic/Latino, and other non-White working class communities. **Evictions and involuntary moves thrust families into [hardship with employment, access to education, loss of benefits, and even securing future housing](https://www.aclu.org/report/no-eviction-without-representation?redirect=evictionbrief) with an eviction record.** In NYC, the baseline shelter application rate of non-evicted households is 3.4%. Before we build more shelters we need to keep folks in their homes. Our Right To Counsel ordinance would be funded by a hike in the rental registration fee landlords with more than 5 units are required to pay. We believe this to be the heart, or the spear, of the policy. Those responsible for this crisis should be the ones that pay, not taxpayers.

## A coalition to win

Rather than wait for our leaders to figure it out and risk a watered down program, we crafted this policy to drastically shift the power imbalance between landlords and tenants. We’re making our politicians choose, either us, or the biggest landlords in the City. We need a bottom-up, grassroots movement to actually win this. [Take action yourself](/takeaction) or ask your organization to [join the coalition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bCq2CavimrqEcziinqsNUi6VhTPvrc1rND_B-Hl3aE/edit) to organize and win. Collect petitions, knock doors, and organize tenants to win this ordinance in the City Council. Let’s fight for the Right to Counsel in Jersey City!
