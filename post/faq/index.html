When represented through RTC programs, tenants are <a href=http://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/275/NCCRC_2021_eviction_RTC_talking_points.pdf>much more likely</a> to stay in their homes — as much as 41% — because lawyers can help tenants identify available defenses and resources like rental assistance programs. Further, in other jurisdictions that have passed right to counsel legislation, the overall number of eviction filings dropped by more than <a href="https://www.cssny.org/news/entry/right-to-counsel-new-york-tenants-lawyers-evictions#:~:text=New%20York%20City%27s%20Right%20to,to%20counsel%20in%20housing%20court">30%</a>, likely because landlords recognize that baseless, harassing, or discriminatory evictions will not longer go unnoticed.</p><p><strong>How would the right to counsel protect tenants from their landlords in other ways?</strong></p><p>This policy recognizes that people can be forced out of their homes in many ways and provides representation in those circumstances, including receiving an order of eviction or other form of landlord malfeasance, like unaddressed code violations or discriminatory treatment.</p><p><strong>Who would qualify for the right to counsel?</strong></p><p>All tenants in Jersey City will have the right to counsel, regardless of income. Rights must be guaranteed to everyone.</p><p><strong>Will the cost of implementing the right to counsel fall on taxpayers and thus tenants?</strong></p><p><em>It will not.</em> Those responsible for the eviction crisis – landlords and developers – should be the ones who pay.</p><p><strong>How will the right to counsel policy be enacted and protected?</strong></p><p>Our proposal includes a Right-to-Counsel office established by the city where tenants will be connected to legal services and resources like rental assistance programs. We will also establish an implementation oversight board led by tenants. Landlords will be required to inform tenants of their right to counsel, when signing a lease and before serving a notice of eviction.</p><p><strong>Will the right to counsel policy cover undocumented people?</strong></p><p>Yes, a right isn&rsquo;t a right if it&rsquo;s qualified. Jersey City is one of the most diverse cities in America: it’s unique in its history as an immigration hub and a sanctuary city. A right to counsel is for all tenants.</p><h2 id=statistics>Statistics</h2><p><strong>NYC Right to Counsel’s Impact</strong></p><p>Prior to RTC’s implementation, only one percent of tenants were represented by an attorney in eviction cases, magnifying the power imbalance between landlords and tenants. In the last quarter of FY2021, 74 percent of tenants facing eviction cases were represented by a lawyer, according to the <a href=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hra/downloads/pdf/services/civiljustice/OCJ_UA_Annual_Report_2021.pdf>Office of Civil Justice</a>. For the third year in a row, 84 percent of tenants represented in housing court by RTC lawyers were able to remain in their homes.</p><p>In particular, Right to Counsel makes it more difficult for landlords to use evictions as a harassment tactic. <strong>In New York City, eviction filings declined by about 30 percent after the implementation of Right to Counsel.</strong></p><p>Comparing Hudson County (modeled data) with Philadelphia & NYC (RTC cities)<br><em>Source: <a href=https://evictionlab.org/methods/#what-data>Eviction Lab modeled data from 2018</a></em></p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left></th><th style=text-align:left>Philadelphia County</th><th style=text-align:left>Hudson County</th><th style=text-align:left>Kings County</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Population</td><td style=text-align:left>1.58 Million</td><td style=text-align:left>669,000</td><td style=text-align:left>2,600,000</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Eviction Filing Rate</td><td style=text-align:left>7.7%</td><td style=text-align:left>7.8%</td><td style=text-align:left>9.1%</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Eviction Filings</td><td style=text-align:left>23,100</td><td style=text-align:left>14,800</td><td style=text-align:left>65,100</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Household Threatened Rate</td><td style=text-align:left>6.8%</td><td style=text-align:left>5.8%</td><td style=text-align:left>7%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As evictions return to and exceed pre-pandemic levels, eviction data has been hard to acquire, especially from Hudson County. Eviction Lab, a research group from Princeton University has provided us with modeled data for eviction rates in Hudson County. Despite being much less populous, Hudson County contends with its two major city neighbors in evictions, and households threatened with eviction.</p></section></div><footer id=footer><section><form method=post action=https://getform.io/f/5ddc2e40-ed41-46fa-95b4-20e576c25701><div class=fields><div class=field><label for=name>Name</label>
